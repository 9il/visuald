
This is the README file for visuald, a 
Visual Studio package providing both project management and language services

Copyright (c) 2010 by Rainer Schuetze, All Rights Reserved

Visual D aims at providing seamless integration of the D programming language into Visual Studio. 

Major Features
---------------
* Project management
  - all DMD command line options accessable
  - support for resource compiler
  - custom build commands
  - pre/post custom build steps
  - automatic dependency generation
  - automatic link between dependend projects
* Language Service
  - syntax highlighting
  - simple word-completion
  - import statement completion
  - goto definition (using JSON file from compilation)
  - smart indentation
  - highlight/jump-to matching braces
* Supported Visual Studio versions
  - VS.NET 2003 (some limitations apply)
  - VS 2005
  - VS 2008
  - VS 2010 (some limitations apply)

* Includes tools to
  - convert some idl/h files of the Windows SDK to D
  - convert all idl/h files from the Visual Studio Integration SDK to D
  - convert C++ code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    the DMD front end to D, but this was abandoned)
  - convert Java code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    parts of the Eclipse plugin Descent to D, but this was abandoned)
  
* Completely written in D2

Installation
------------
There is a click-through-installer available at http://www.dsource.org/projects/visuald
that will guide you through the intallation process. The installer lets you select the
Visual Studio Version for which you want Visual D to be installed. It will always install
for all users, not only for a single user.

For debugging applications built with DMD, you should also install cv2pdb from
http://www.dsource.org/projects/cv2pdb.

Building from Source
--------------------
The source of Visual D is available from the SVN repository at 
http://svn.dsource.org/projects/visuald.

You need the following tools to build Visual D:
 - Visual Studio 2008 (other version might also work, but I haven't tried)
 - Visual Studio Integration SDK
 - DMD 2.042 or later 
 - NSIS
 - for debugging: cv2pdb

Unfortunately, there are some patches necessary to DMD and the D runtime
library for compilation. These include

 * [http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3200 Issue 3200] std.xml doesn't follow spec for Tag.text
 * [http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3415 Issue 3415] broken JSON output  
 * [http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4015 Issue 4015] forward reference in alias causes error
 * [http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4069 Issue 4069] std.xml.Document.pretty saves empty elements with spaces and line breaks
 * [http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4089 Issue 4089] crash when creating JSON output for incomplete struct 
 * [http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4092 Issue 4092] broken memory management for COM objects derived from IUnknown

The standard build procedure for the release version is to execute 
"nmake install" in the trunk directory.

If you want to start developing or debugging, you should execute
"nmake" at least once to build the necessary D translations from
the Windows and Visual Studio SDK. Afterwards you can use the solution visuald.sln.
It contains the necessary makefile-projects.

You should debug the plugin within Visual Studio using a different
branch in the registry, so it does not interfere with your working
environment. To create a configuration named "D", execute

 devenv.exe /RootSuffix D

once from the comamnd line. The compiled debug plugin can then be registered
with nsis\register.bat.
