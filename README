  - support for resource compiler
  - custom build commands
  - pre/post custom build steps
  - automatic dependency generation
  - automatic link between dependend projects
  - integrates cv2pdb for seamless debugger integration 
  - new project templates

* Language Service
  - syntax highlighting with special version/debug and token string support
  - underlining of syntactical errors 
  - simple word-completion
  - import statement completion
  - goto definition (using JSON file from compilation)
  - parameter info tooltips

  - browse information displayed in object browser and class view 
  - help on language and runtime library
  - experimental: semantic analysis for code completion and tool tips

* Other
  - symbol/file search window
  - profiler window 
  - C++ to D conversion wizard 
    
* Supported Visual Studio versions
  - VS.NET 2003 (some limitations apply)
  - VS 2005
  - VS 2008
  - VS 2010

  Unfortunately, Express versions of Visual Studio do not support this 
  kind of extensions. Use the Visual Studio Shell instead (see the Visual
  D home page for links).
  
* Includes tools to
  - convert some idl/h files of the Windows SDK to D
  - convert all idl/h files from the Visual Studio Integration SDK to D
  - convert C++ code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    the DMD front end to D, but this was abandoned)
  - convert Java code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    parts of the Eclipse plugin Descent to D, but this was abandoned)
  
* Completely written in D2

Installation
------------

The click-through-installer will guide you through the intallation process. 
The installer lets you select the Visual Studio Version for which you want 
Visual D to be installed. It will always install for all users, not only for 
a single user.

To compile your application, you must have DMD installed.

For debugging applications, you should also install cv2pdb which is now 
included in the Visual D installer. Please make sure, changes to 
Common7\Packages\Debugger\autoexp.dat do not mix with previous manual 
installations of cv2pdb. 

Unfortunately, if you are using the Visual Studio Shell, it misses one file,
that is needed for the conversion of the debug information by cv2pdb. This 
is msobj80.dll for VS2008 and msobj100.dll for VS2010 and must be extracted 
from a standard installation, the Visual C Express edition or the Windows SDK.
You might also find it installed by other Microsoft products. 

Changes

previous versions, please see the file CHANGES.
