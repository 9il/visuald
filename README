
This is the README file for visuald, a 
Visual Studio package providing both project management and language services

Copyright (c) 2010 by Rainer Schuetze, All Rights Reserved

Visual D aims at providing seamless integration of the D programming language
into Visual Studio. 

Major Features
---------------
* Project management
  - all DMD command line options accessable
  - support for resource compiler
  - custom build commands
  - pre/post custom build steps
  - automatic dependency generation
  - automatic link between dependend projects
  - integrates cv2pdb for seamless debugger integration 
  - new project templates

* Language Service
  - syntax highlighting
  - simple word-completion
  - import statement completion
  - goto definition (using JSON file from compilation)
  - smart indentation
  - highlight/jump-to matching braces
  - code snippets
  - parameter tooltips
  
* Supported Visual Studio versions
  - VS.NET 2003 (some limitations apply)
  - VS 2005
  - VS 2008
  - VS 2010
  Unfortunately, Express versions of Visual Studio do not support this 
  kind of extensions. Use the Visual Studio Shell instead (see the Visual
  D home page for links).
  
* Includes tools to
  - convert some idl/h files of the Windows SDK to D
  - convert all idl/h files from the Visual Studio Integration SDK to D
  - convert C++ code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    the DMD front end to D, but this was abandoned)
  - convert Java code to D (which was targeted at machine-translating
    parts of the Eclipse plugin Descent to D, but this was abandoned)
  
* Completely written in D2
