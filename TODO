This is the TODO file for visuald, a 
Visual Studio package providing both project management and language services

Copyright (c) 2011 by Rainer Schuetze, All Rights Reserved

This file lists issues that I'm aware of and hope to resolve in the near future,
but no guarantees.

Settings:
---------------
- different global settings for D1/D2
- browse-buttons for path input lines

Project:
---------------
- clean/build/rebuild only project not working
- incorrect build order of single file compilations (check dependencies)
- sort project items
- split compile/link for multiobj?
- midl compiler?
- manifest compiler?
- no automatic lib dependencies
- lib path not passed to dmd (needs patched sc.ini in dmd installation)
- remove auto-tool?
- automation objects incomplete?
- exceptions when opening rc-file with project
- buildlog should contain project name to disambiguate
- adding new item to project causes lots of System.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException
  which seems like a frozen UI (only first dialog open)

Language service:
---------------
- goto definition does not know about scope
- use spell-checker on completion?
- code definition window
- cursor-location-stack
- showScope: function/delegate literal not shown correctly, in/out/body
- remember line changes since last build to adjust gotoDefinition line numbers

Search:
---------------
- icons depending on type
- resort columns
- button state not shown correctly after switching search type
- do not add definition again if on same line
- crashes when searching C# project?

Profile:
---------------
- splitter for fan in/out windows
- switch window layout to fan in/out side by side

Installation:
---------------
- build sdk-imports
