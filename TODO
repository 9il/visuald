This is the TODO file for visuald, a 
Visual Studio package providing both project management and language services

Copyright (c) 2011 by Rainer Schuetze, All Rights Reserved

This file lists issues that I'm aware of and hope to resolve in the near future,
but no guarantees.

Settings:
---------------
- different global settings for D1/D2?
- browse-buttons for path input lines

Project:
---------------
- clean/build/rebuild only project not working
- midl compiler?
- manifest compiler?
- no automatic lib dependencies
- no dependencies to files referenced by import expressions
- lib path not passed to dmd (needs patched sc.ini in dmd installation)
- remove auto-tool?
- automation objects incomplete?
- exceptions when opening rc-file with project
- adding new item to project causes lots of System.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException
  which seems like a frozen UI (only first dialog open)
- incremental builds?
- DnD files/folders loses project file settings
- retreive both filename and name in the solution, and make them accessible through variables
- different icon for project items after changing tool
- what happens without d file on the command line?
- template to create a Visual D project from an existing source tree
- project config: edit all configurations only changes current config

Language service:
---------------
- goto definition does not know about scope
- use spell-checker on completion?
- case insensitive completion?
- showScope: function/delegate literal not shown correctly, in/out/body
- collapse disabled version/debug blocks
- disable parsing/outlining for large files?
- version highlighting does not support version(x): syntax
- replace token: empty dialog when opened without resizing
- when hovering identifier with preceding dot, include identifier before dot in debugger tool tip
- check indentation of multiple string literals on several lines
- show help in standard browser
- VS no longer remembers position inside file across restart?

Search:
---------------
- icons depending on type
- resort columns
- button state not shown correctly after switching search type
- crashes when searching C# project?
- update result list after build
- update too slow when typing filter

Object Browser:
---------------
- Show full information/hierarchy in base classes
- Derived types
- inherited members
- enum base classes
- modules without module statement shown with empty name
- restrict "My Solution" to classes in projects in solution
- list projects in "Custom Components"
- split constraint from name
- description: hyperlinks to other symbols

Profile:
---------------
- splitter for fan in/out windows
- switch window layout to fan in/out side by side

Lexer/Parser:
---------------
- fix Cmp/ShiftExpression
- octal numbers
- do not parse file if it is D1
- deprecated syntax

Installation:
---------------
- build sdk-imports
- add dmd-installation via ftp

Debugger:
---------------
- show derived class
- step after exception
- stepping through function call jumps to default assignment
- Mago: set instruction pointer
- local functions/delegates should have debug info for closure vars ("this" exists)
