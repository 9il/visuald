This is the TODO file for visuald, a 
Visual Studio package providing both project management and language services

Copyright (c) 2011 by Rainer Schuetze, All Rights Reserved

This file lists issues that I'm aware of and hope to resolve in the near future,
but no guarantees.

Settings:
---------------
- different global settings for D1/D2?
- browse-buttons for path input lines

Project:
---------------
- clean/build/rebuild only project not working
- midl compiler?
- manifest compiler?
- no dependencies to files referenced by import expressions
- remove auto-tool?
- automation objects incomplete?
- exceptions when opening rc-file with project
- adding new item to project causes lots of System.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException
  which seems like a frozen UI (only first dialog open)
- incremental builds?
- DnD files/folders loses project file settings
- retreive both filename and name in the solution, and make them accessible through variables
- different icon for project items after changing tool
- what happens without d file on the command line?
- template to create a Visual D project from an existing source tree
- breaking into build does not stop dmd
- environment variables with parenthesis don't work $(ProgramFiles(x86))
- GDC: 
  - separate compile + link does not write to object dir
  - ddoc files
- additional options for resource compiler
- pass import path from static lib project to dependent projects
- single file compilation for file configuration
- custom command: quotes in dependencies not supported
- different lib paths for Win32/Win64
- support [Environment64] in sc.ini

Language service:
-----------------
- goto definition does not know about scope
- use spell-checker on completion?
- case insensitive completion?
- showScope: function/delegate literal not shown correctly, in/out/body
- disable parsing/outlining for large files?
- replace token: empty dialog when opened without resizing
- check indentation of multiple string literals on several lines
- show help in standard browser
- VS sometimes does not remember position inside file across restart?
- goto import jumps to "mod" if run on "import mod = pkg.mod;"
- support DDoc comment in JSON file
- goto definition might jump to wrong file if identically named files in solution
- file source navigation menus
- spurious display of completion box

Lexer/Parser:
---------------
- fix Cmp/ShiftExpression
- octal numbers
- do not parse file if it is D1?
- deprecated syntax
- syntax error with "@disable new()"
+ integrate d_parser.dll
- 0.ident

Semantics:
---------------
- semantic support for => delegates
- import paths for source files not in any project
- invalidate after changes
- templates
- operator overloads
- UFCS
- completion at the beginning of an identifier lists its members
- package/module specifier before symbol
- vdserver.exe should remove semantic project if devenv.exe terminates
- vdserver.exe should terminate if devenv.exe crashes
- expansion fails too often
- handle parser error at caret better for expansion/definition

Search:
---------------
- icons depending on type
- resort columns
- button state not shown correctly after switching search type
- crashes when searching C# project?
- update result list after build
- update too slow when typing filter
- VS2012: focus not in edit line after opening dialog

Object Browser:
---------------
- Show full information/hierarchy in base classes
- Derived types
- inherited members
- enum base classes
- modules without module statement shown with empty name
- restrict "My Solution" to classes in projects in solution
- list projects in "Custom Components"
- split constraint from name
- description: hyperlinks to other symbols

Profile:
---------------
- splitter for fan in/out windows
- switch window layout to fan in/out side by side

C++ to D
---------
- documentation
- parse operators
- edit fields sometimes do not support Ctrl-C/V

Installation:
---------------
- build sdk-imports
- add dmd-installation via ftp

Debugger:
---------------
- show derived class
- step after exception
- stepping through function call jumps to default assignment
- Mago: set instruction pointer
- local functions/delegates should have debug info for closure vars ("this" exists)
- GDC: x64: function arguments not shown
- VS2012: autoexp.dat does not work? depends on debug engine => edit and continue

GUI-Designer:
-------------
- Form designer: see IVSMDDesignerService


Unsorted
=========
- parse all files in project at startup
- COM leaks in VS2012 (VS2010?)
- virustotal reports malicious software
- reset semantic analysis data
- goto definition/completion for labels, versions
- goto definition fallback to JSON
- highlight compiler-magic identifiers

- compile from selection/buffer (through rdmd)
- save file before "Compile & run"
- coverage line highlight after "Compile & run" doesn't update
- better keeping track of line changes
